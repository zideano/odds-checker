# Text fragmentation

Write a program to reassemble a given set of text fragments into their original sequence. 
For this challenge your program should have a main method accepting one argument â€“ the path 
to a well-formed UTF-8 encoded text file. Each line in the file represents a test case of the main 
functionality of your program: read it, process it and println to the console the corresponding defragmented output.
